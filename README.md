I made an employee health and employment status tracking application.

So the employee clicks whether they have covid or not, also if there are working from home, in office etc

The manager logs in and can view the statistics and graphs eg how many have covid, what percentage of staff are working from home. I used sql queries to collect this information from the database and analyse it.

It's written in python using the Flask web framework. I created a database to store the data using SQLite.
